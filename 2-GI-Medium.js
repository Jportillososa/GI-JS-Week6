// MEDIUM: Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you 
// beforehand. (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).



const array = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];


console.log(array.indexOf(8)); // console logs 6
console.log(array.indexOf(9)); //console logs -1
